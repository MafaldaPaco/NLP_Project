# NLP_Project
The goal of this project is to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to predict whether a property listed on Airbnb will be unlisted in the next quarter. To accomplish this, we will leverage real Airbnb property descriptions, Airbnb host descriptions, and comments from previous guests.
