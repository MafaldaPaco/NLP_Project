# NLP_Project

This repository is a university project showcasing my NLP (Natural Language Processing) skills.

### Airbnb Property Unlisting Prediction

The goal of this project is to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) models to predict whether a property listed on Airbnb will be unlisted in the next quarter. To accomplish this, we will leverage real Airbnb property descriptions, Airbnb host descriptions, and comments from previous guests.

Using the NLP techniques, we will implement an NLP classification model that can accurately predict, for each property, whether it will be unlisted (1) or remain listed (0).

## Notebooks
There are two different notebooks available in this repository:

- `NLP_15_exploration.ipynb`: This notebook contains the data exploration code and explanations.

- `NLP_15_main.ipynb`: This notebook has the embeddings.

## Files

The repository includes the following important files:

- `reviews_language.csv`: Dataset file containing the language of each comment.
- `test.xlsx`: Additional test data file.
- `test_reviews.xlsx`: Test data file for reviews.
- `train.xlsx`: Additional training data file.
- `train_reviews.xlsx`: Training data file for reviews.
- `Report_15.pdf`: The report.

Please note that only the essential files are included in the repository due to their large size. However, you can find everything you need within the notebooks themselves.
